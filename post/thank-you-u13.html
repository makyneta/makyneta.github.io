                    Today, June 28th, I conclude my time at Atlético Clube Marinhense, but of course, I couldn't leave
                    without thanking those who helped me the most.
                </p>

                    It was thanks to the U-13s at ACM that I was able to grow, and of course, make new friends, and
                    progress in my work as a photographer.

                <p>
                    It all started with a simple photography internship, but in the end, it was a boom.
                    It was thanks to these people that I finally decided, once and for all, what I wanted to pursue in
                    life.
                    And of course, it was also thanks to them that I became a better person.

                <p>
                    After two months of internship, I only have gratitude to express... Not only to my coordinator, but
                    to everyone, families, players, coaches, management, everyone!
